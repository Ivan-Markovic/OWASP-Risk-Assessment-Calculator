# OWASP-Risk-Assessment-Calculator
This Risk Rating Calculator is based on OWASP's Risk Rating Methodology: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology

Rewrited from some old script from "The Net" by Ivan MarkoviÄ‡ <ivanm@security-net.biz> | Tnx @commjoenie for motivation :) 

TODO: Optimize code, implement configurator for custom values in select boxes, more suggestions?

Online version: https://security-net.biz/files/owaspriskcalc.html

# Update: 

The script is outdated and needs a rewrite. Hotfixes are applied to meet minimum requirements.
